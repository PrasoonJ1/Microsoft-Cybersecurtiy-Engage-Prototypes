*Now ,we will create a socket*

*We will use an empty dictionary*

dict = {}

*The following line of code will open a text file, having the details of DDoS attack in append mode*

*With the help of following line of code, current time will be written whenever the program runs*

file_txt.writelines(t1)

*Now, we need to assume the hits from a particular IP. Here we are assuming that if a particular IP is hitting for more than 15 times then it would be an attck*
