*Import the necessary libraries*

import socket
import struct

from datetime import datetime

*Now ,we will create a socket*

s = socket.socket(socket.PF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW, 8)


*We will use an empty dictionary*

dict = {}

*The following line of code will open a text file, having the details of DDoS attack in append mode*

file_txt = open("attack_DDoS.txt",'a')
t1 = str(datetime.now())


*With the help of following line of code, current time will be written whenever the program runs*

file_txt.writelines(t1)
file_txt.writelines("\n")


*Now, we need to assume the hits from a particular IP. Here we are assuming that if a particular IP is hitting for more than 15 times then it would be an attack*

No_of_IPs = 15
R_No_of_IPs = No_of_IPs +10
   while True:
      pkt = s.recvfrom(2048)
      ipheader = pkt[0][14:34]
      ip_hdr = struct.unpack("!8sB3s4s4s",ipheader)
      IP = socket.inet_ntoa(ip_hdr[3])
      print "The Source of the IP is:", IP

*The following line of code will check whether the IP exists in dictionary or not. If it exists then it will increase it by 1*

if dict.has_key(IP):
   dict[IP] = dict[IP]+1
   print dict[IP]


*The next line of code is used to remove redundancy*

if(dict[IP] > No_of_IPs) and (dict[IP] < R_No_of_IPs) :
   line = "DDOS attack is Detected: "
   file_txt.writelines(line)
   file_txt.writelines(IP)
   file_txt.writelines("\n")
else:
   dict[IP] = 1
*After running the above script, we will get the result in a text file. According to the script, if an IP hits for more than 15 times then it would be printed as a DDoS attack*
